#' Calculate the average centipawn loss.
#'
#' @details Calculates the average centipawn loss (ACPL) for the side indicated
#'   by the `color` parameter. The `score` parameter is assumed to begin with a
#'   score for the initial position, prior to the first move. Note that when
#'   pgn files store evaluation scores, the score for the initial position is
#'   omitted. It is up to the user to supply a score for the initial position
#'   before calling `get_acpl()`.
#'
#' @details Evaluations may be capped to avoid having blunders or missed mates
#'   result in excessively large ACPL. If the `cap` parameter is set, then
#'   evaluations outside the range \[-cap, cap\] will be handled as indicated
#'   by the `cap_action` parameter.
#'
#' @details For positions evaluated as 'mate in x', it is up to the user to
#'   convert these to numeric scores before calling `get_acpl()`. In general,
#'   if a cap will be applied to evaluations, it is only necessary to convert
#'   'mate x' or 'mate -x' to values outside the range \[-cap, cap\]. The rbitr
#'   function `convert_scores()` may be used for this conversion.
#'
#' @details The method for calculating average centipawn loss varies.
#'   In Guid & Bratko, 'MeanLoss' is calculated only after excluding
#'   the first 12 moves, and also after excluding moves where both the best move
#'   and the played move result in evaluations outside the range \[-200, 200\].
#'   To replicate Guid & Bratko's MeanLoss, set `cap` to 200, `cap_action` to
#'   'exclude' and, `first_ply` to 25.
#'
#' @details The website lichess.org uses a different method, in which
#'   evaluations outside the range \[-1000, 1000\] are replaced with +-1000, and
#'   the initial position is always given a score of 15. To replicate the
#'   lichess ACPL, set `cap` to 1000, `cap_action` to 'replace', and make sure
#'   that the first element of the `scores` parameter is equal to 15.
#'
#' @note For games that use alternative starting positions, it is possible for
#'   black to have first move. In these situations, set the `to_move` parameter
#'   to 'black'.
#'
#' @param scores A numeric or integer vector of evaluations, in centipawns.
#' @param color A single-element character vector indicating which side to
#'   evaluate. Allowed values are 'black' or 'white'.
#' @param cap (Default = NULL) A single-element numeric or integer vector
#'   indicating the threshold for capping a move's loss (or excluding the move
#'   from the average).
#' @param cap_action (Default = NULL) A single-element character vector
#'   indicating whether to exclude scores outside the range \[-cap, cap\], or to
#'   replace them with the cap. Allowed values are 'exclude', 'replace', or
#'   'none'.
#' @param first_ply (Default = 1) A single-element integer vector indicating the
#'   first ply to be included in the calculation. May not be larger than the
#'   number of elements in `score`.
#' @param to_move (Default = 'white') A single-element character vector
#'   indicating which side's turn it is.
#'
#' @return A single-element integer vector of the average centipawn loss.
